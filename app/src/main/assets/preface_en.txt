PREFACE
The following pages are a translation of the Ricordi e Detti di San Filippo Neri, published at Turin.
Their purpose cannot be better described than in the words of the Italian editor: “It was the aim
and study of the holy father, Philip Neri, to introduce among Christians a daily spiritual repast. His
children, who have drunk of the spirit of their holy father, have always sought to cultivate this
custom of a spiritual repast among devout persons; and among the plans which they have tried,
and the practices they have introduced, one, gentle reader, is a collection of the sayings and doings
of the Saint, distributed into the number of the days of the year, to the end that every one might
have each day, either a maxim to meditate upon, or a virtue to copy. The method of using these
sayings and doings, is to read only one of them each day, and that the one set apart for the current
day, (for to read more would not be food but curiosity,) and then to regulate the actions of the day
by that maxim or example. I am sure that by doing this you will reap an abundant harvest, especially
if to the maxim or example you add some particular devotion to the Saint who was the author of
it. I think it useless to make any long commendation of this practice; but it is well you should know
that by the daily suggestion of such truths, the fruit which the saint obtained in Rome was immense;
and so also will it be in your soul if you practise it in a true spirit of devotion. Farewell.”
