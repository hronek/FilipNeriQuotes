<p>THE HEART OF SAINT PHILIP NERI <br/> <br/>EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>edited by Simone Raponi</p>

<p>PRESENTATION <br/> <br/>What can we know about a man who lived and worked a full five hundred years ago, and who, moreover, left nothing in writing? According to the natural course of this world's history, his memory should have been lost for centuries. And yet, Saint Philip Neri is still known, loved, and invoked throughout the world by many as a special patron. <br/>This is what happens to those who are in the world but not of the world, that is, to those who give themselves with such generosity to the Holy Spirit that their very life becomes a living expression of the Kingdom of Heaven, a sure guide for those who wish to undertake a serious journey of faith. <br/>Father Philip's pastoral method had nothing "studied" about it, but thanks to his daily encounters with people, so simple, genuine, and deeply imbued with healthy humanity, Father Philip Neri knew how to draw a host of men behind him, forming them in the school of the gospel, making them authentic disciples of Jesus and transforming with his pastoral action the dramatic and tense face of sixteenth-century Rome, to the point of earning the title of second apostle of Rome. <br/>This little volume allows us in some way to place ourselves in his daily school, as it distills a phrase of authentic spiritual direction for every day of the year. <br/>It was those his spiritual children who testified in the Processes for his canonization, still remembering with emotion, making it possible to attest in writing, many of those words and recommendations they received from their spiritual father throughout their lives, feeling themselves thus lovingly and competently guided on the way to Heaven. It is only thanks to them that his spiritual heritage could be collected. Short phrases, sometimes very short, but a concentrate of pure wisdom, which offers a notable starting point for meditation and arouses a burning desire to conform to it. One will easily notice how the Filippian method does not consist of particularly complicated ascetic practices, but in a profound knowledge of the heart and the human soul, from which he wanted to uproot the root of every sin: pride. Hence the insistence on the mortification "of the rational" more than the corporal; the importance of obedience and the blind trust he demanded from his disciples so that they would set aside self-love and too much esteem for their own feelings. <br/>All this in a method so original that even jokes and teasing found their place, making the way of mortification ironic and pleasant. <br/>Knowing Saint Philip Neri and placing oneself under his spiritual guidance is, still today, a unique experience within the spiritual heritage of the Church: it is the opportunity to undertake a profound journey into the heart of man and to open oneself to the knowledge of the love of God. <br/> <br/>P. Rocco Camillò C. O. <br/>Provost of the Congregation of the Oratory of Rome</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION <br/> <br/>"The aim of Saint Philip was to form his disciples rather than to impose laws on them, so that they themselves might become living laws, so that, in the words of Sacred Scripture, the laws might be written in their hearts." <br/>SAINT JOHN HENRY NEWMAN, Discourse to the Chapter, February 9, 1848 <br/> <br/> <br/>"Let it not be said: great things the Saints do; but great things God does in his Saints," Saint Philip Neri specified. He had well understood that one is holy, to the extent that the stature of the Lord grows in the heart of man. It is in the molding of the heart to the image of Christ – and not in particular heroisms – that the secret of authentic holiness lies. To remove from us the heart of stone and replace it with a heart of flesh – to borrow the image from Sacred Scripture (cf. Ez 36:26) – constitutes the greatest work of God in our life and the most complete fulfillment of our aspirations. <br/>The state of our heart, in fact, constitutes the perfect cipher of who we really are. <br/>When in our common speech we use similar expressions: "I opened my heart," "my heart was broken," "I give you my heart," etc., we consider the "heart" as the center of our person. In this sense, the term does not merely indicate a vital organ, but its meaning expands towards the multiple richness of the symbol. Thus, a single word is sufficient to express "love," "affections," "soul," "feelings," "will," "emotions," etc. <br/>To know the "heart" of a person means to penetrate into their inner world, to look them in the eye and glimpse a *magis* irreducible to visible actions and gestures, to read between the lines of their life to discover the uniqueness of their mystery, to listen to the said and unsaid of their words, savoring their silences. Only starting from this authentic and never banalizing gaze, will we be able to truly approach the soul of a man. <br/>An undertaking undoubtedly not easy, even in the most intimate relationships. <br/>How, then, to know the heart of someone distant from us in space and time? How to attempt to glimpse the unfathomable richness of a person we have never directly met? On closer inspection, it is an experience not totally foreign to us. <br/>We all feel the "presence," for example, of those more or less distant relatives, whose works, sayings, teachings, memories are handed down in our family. We look at their photographs, trying to grasp their temperament. We have their life told to us, while we remain enchanted by the original and fascinating anecdotes that populate it. We learn their typical expressions, which gradually become more and more familiar to us. <br/>This dynamic – typical of oral culture – is enriched by the value of the person being remembered. All the more so if it is a Saint, alive, praying, and present as an intercessor in the communion of life among all those who belong to Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>In the case of Philip Neri, who chose not to entrust his biographical and spiritual experiences to any written work, the above-described dynamic becomes even more evident. We know the "heart" of Philip through his teachings, transmitted by his first disciples and, more generally, witnessed by those struck by his irresistibly magnetic personality. <br/>Far from presenting itself as a systematic theory of spiritual life, the Saint's lesson, condensed into short and incisive sayings, maintains a simple and direct freshness, yet imbued with the highest wisdom and effective spiritual force. Philip's maxims, free of artificial literary refinements, constitute true precious gems, from which a vibrant light emanates, capable of guiding the steps and warming the hearts of disciples. <br/> In them, the changing colors of sweetness and strength, meekness and parrhesia, reproach and forgiveness, humility and trust alternate, in a full balance that only illuminated souls know how to achieve. Hence Philip's spiritual ability to generate children for God, in a form of paternity, which unfolds more in example than in instruction, more in discernment than in the imposition of a stereotypical model of holiness, more in confident abandonment to God than in clumsy attempts at self-improvement. <br/>Philip never tires of pointing out the *unum necessarium*, which is the silent truth of the divine Reality, which loves gratuitously with paternal and maternal love, and pours out upon creatures the superabundance of his life. To us falls the commitment to allow it to fill the voids dug by our stories of harshness and mute pain. To us, then, the task of welcoming it, letting it widen the spaces – often narrow and twilight – of our heart. <br/>Philip had understood it well, because he had experienced it physically and spiritually. Absorbed in prayer in the catacombs of San Sebastiano in 1544, he was so violently pervaded by the Holy Spirit that he bore in his own body the burning stigmata of the dilation of the heart, the detachment of two ribs, as well as a strong palpitation that would accompany him for the rest of his life. This was his personal Pentecost, which mystically burned his heart without consuming it and which radically oriented him towards his only Pole Star: "He who wants anything but Christ," he repeated, "does not know what he wants; he who asks for anything but Christ, does not know what he asks for; he who works, and not for Christ, does not know what he does." <br/>The extraordinary touch of the Spirit infused in Philip the communication of God's very life, with all the abyssal love and incorruptible fertility that belong to it. <br/>The living water of God's Spirit irrigated Philip's interiority to such an extent that in all his existence, in what he did and in what he said, the excess of that divine fire, which burns eternally in the hearth of the Trinity, was manifested *sine modo*. With Saint Paul, Philip too could repeat: "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me" (Gal 2:20).</p>

<p>Only starting from this central affirmation can we place in the right perspective the well-known joy of the Saint, the sober madness that cracks the gilding of appearances, the ecstasies, the clairvoyance, the charity expressed in creative and singular forms, as well as the tireless insistence on the exercise of Christian virtues and the necessity of the sacraments. <br/>The darting sparks of Philip's *cor flammigerum* still shine today in his maxims, which present themselves as incandescent fragments of a multifaceted inspired wisdom, to be savored in a climate of assiduous meditation, and then to put their suggestions into practice. The distribution of these sayings for every day of the year will help each of us to distill them in our own *palato cordis*, thus inviting us to rediscover the sublimity and nourish the life of the inner man, because "even though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day" (2 Cor 4:16). <br/> <br/> <br/>Simone Raponi</p>

<p>CHRONOLOGY OF THE LIFE OF SAINT PHILIP NERI <br/> <br/>1515 <br/> <br/>On July 21, 1515, in Florence, Filippo Neri was born to Francesco and Lucrezia da Mosciano. His father, originally from Castelfranco di Sopra, practiced the profession of notary. <br/>Filippo was the second-born of four children: Caterina, Elisabetta, and Antonio, who died prematurely shortly after birth. <br/>In 1520-1521 the family lost the mother Lucrezia, and Francesco Neri remarried Alessandra di Michele Lensi, who knew how to love "good Pippo" tenderly. <br/> <br/>1531-1532 <br/> <br/>Having completed his initial education with the Dominicans of the convent of San Marco, Filippo leaves his native Florence – politically shaken by the expulsion of the Medici and the advent of the republic, guided according to the spirit of Girolamo Savonarola – to head towards San Germano (Cassino), where a relative would have offered him good opportunities in the mercantile field. <br/> <br/>1533-1534 <br/> <br/>After realizing that mercantile activity was not for him, Filippo decides to go to Rome, where he will work as a tutor in the house of the papal customs officer Galeotto Caccia. The compensation included lodging and frugal board. <br/> <br/>1535-1537 <br/> <br/>Filippo studies philosophy and theology with the Augustinians and at La Sapienza, but already in '37 he abandons his studies, irresistibly attracted to a life of asceticism and prayer. <br/>He dedicates himself to assisting the sick in the hospital of San Giacomo degli Incurabili and meets the first Jesuits who arrived in Rome, including Saint Ignatius of Loyola, Diego Laínez, and Alfonso Salmerón, whose preaching he listens to with interest in the church of Santa Maria della Strada.</p>

<p>1544 <br/> <br/>It was the year of a profound mystical experience, which tradition places in the catacombs of San Sebastiano, on the eve of Pentecost. During an intense prayer, in which Filippo asked to "have spirit," the Holy Spirit penetrated "physically" into him, causing a real dilation of his heart, later attested by the autopsy. This was the extraordinary effusion that introduced him for the rest of his life into the sphere of mystical experience. <br/> <br/>1548 <br/> <br/>Together with his confessor, Father Persiano Rosa, Filippo gave life to the Confraternity of the Holy Trinity, dedicated primarily to Eucharistic worship, the welcome of pilgrims (especially during the Holy Year of 1550), as well as the assistance of poor people discharged from hospitals. <br/> <br/>1551 <br/> <br/>Spurred by the spiritual advice of Father Rosa, Filippo receives the minor orders and the subdiaconate in the church of San Tommaso in Parione; the diaconate in San Giovanni in Laterano; and on May 23 he is ordained a priest in San Tommaso in Parione by the vicegerent Sebastiano Lunel. <br/>He resides at San Girolamo della Carità and in his room welcomes his friends for the familiar treatment of the Word of God. These meetings will constitute the nucleus from which the Oratory will develop. Additional charitable activities and the Visit to the Seven Churches, an ancient penitential pilgrimage, revived by Filippo in a devotional-recreational sense, are also added. <br/> <br/>1556-1557 <br/> <br/>Filippo reads the *Avvisi dalle Indie di Portogallo* and wonders if his vocation is not to become a missionary among peoples not yet reached by the announcement of the Gospel. Regarding this thought, he asks advice from the Cistercian Agostino Ghettini, a monk at Tre Fontane, who will dispel all doubt: "Your Indies will be Rome." This event marks the beginning of a fundamental consolidation for Philip's activity.</p>

<p>1559 <br/> <br/>Filippo, already suspected of surrounding himself with disreputable people, is investigated by the cardinal vicar Virgilio Rosario, who dies on May 22. Pius IV, understanding Filippo's right intentions and the goodness of his work, sends the Father two Candlemas candles as a sign of reconciliation. <br/> <br/>1564 <br/> <br/>Filippo, at the request of his compatriots, assumes the parish guidance of the church of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, where, together with his first disciples ordained priests (Cesare Baronio, Alessandro Fedeli, Giovan Francesco Bordini), he begins a first form of community life. <br/> <br/>1575 <br/> <br/>Gregory XIII officially erects, with the Bull *Copiosus in misericordia* of July 15, the Congregation of the Oratory, to which he entrusts the small church of Santa Maria in Vallicella. Filippo and the newborn Congregation immediately decide to rebuild it. <br/>The first stone is blessed on September 27 by Alessandro de' Medici (later Pope Leo XI). <br/> <br/>1577 <br/> <br/>Alessandro de' Medici celebrates the first mass at the Vallicella on February 3. After the first meeting of the Congregation, on March 15, in May Filippo is elected provost. <br/> <br/>1578 <br/> <br/>The pope visits the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella and one of the Fathers, Francesco Maria Tarugi, draws up a memorandum on the state of the Congregation, as well as a list of members. <br/> <br/>1583 <br/> <br/>On March 16, the famous miracle of the Massimo house occurs. Filippo "resuscitates" the young Paolo, son of Prince Fabrizio. <br/>On November 22, at the request of the pope, Filippo leaves his "nest" of San Girolamo to move to the Vallicella together with the fathers of the new Institute.</p>

<p>1584 <br/> <br/>Filippo is elected provost for life by unanimous vote. <br/> <br/>1592 <br/> <br/>Cardinal Aldobrandini, a disciple of Filippo, ascends to the throne of Peter under the name of Clement VIII. The mutual affection and esteem remained unchanged, even during the pontificate. It will be through Filippo's work, through Baronio's influence, that the Pontiff will decide the reconciliation with Henry IV of France. <br/>Clement VIII esteems the members of Filippo's community and decides to elect Giovan Francesco Bordini as Bishop of Cavaillon and Francesco Maria Tarugi as Archbishop of Avignon. <br/> <br/>1594 <br/> <br/>The pope insists on wanting to make Filippo a cardinal, but – as the testimonies narrate – "the Father took off his cap, looking to heaven, said: 'Paradise, paradise'." <br/> <br/>1595 <br/> <br/>After a series of declines and recoveries, Filippo's health seems to be definitively compromised. Nevertheless, almost miraculously, he manages to celebrate mass on May 23 and the following day, the solemnity of Corpus Domini. <br/>He passes away candidly during the night between May 25 and 26, after having blessed his Congregation. <br/>With extraordinary promptness, on August 2, the process of canonization opens. <br/> <br/>1615 <br/> <br/>On May 25, Paul V enrolls Filippo in the list of the Blessed. <br/> <br/>1622 <br/> <br/>Gregory XV canonizes on March 12 Saint Philip, together with Saint Ignatius of Loyola, Francis Xavier, Teresa of Avila, and Isidore of Seville. The Romans ironically said that that day the Pope had canonized "four Spaniards and a Saint."</p>
